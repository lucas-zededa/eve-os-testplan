EVE Testplan
============

EVE aims to develop an open, agnostic and standardized architecture unifying
the approach to developing and orchestrating cloud-native applications
across the enterprise on-premises edge. It offers users new levels of
control through hardware-assisted virtualization of on-prem edge devices.
Once installed, EVE has direct access to and control of underlying
resources and provides standard APIs that allow more efficient use of
resources and can effectively partition hardware to increase workload
consolidation and application multi-tenancy.

This is a document that covers the testplan for EVE OS.
